# Env-Freeze 

### Abstract
The idea here is to create a identical and portable clone of a python env. Just installing the same packages with the same versions does not result in an 1 to 1 copy due to the fact the the versioning of decency packages can change at any given time.
Example (piptree):
    Here we can see that while we can lock verison of packages 
    autoflake 2.1.1
    └── pyflakes
    └── tomli
    black 23.3.0
    └── click
    └── mypy-extensions
    └── packaging
    └── pathspec
    └── platformdirs
    └── tomli
